tornado-backbone
================

Create backbone models from sqlalchemy models.

Backbone allows to represent your data as models in JavaScript.
However you may not want to do your modeling twice in sqlalchemy aswell in backbone.
Tornado-Backbone approaches to generate the JavaScript models from your sqlalchemy orm.

so there are some specific 'hacks' for them.
